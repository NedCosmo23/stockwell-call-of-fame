# Stockwell Graffiti Hall of Fame
## Milestone Project One

This site will inform the user on the history of the space, have information on upcoming events (music/graffiti/sports/etc), and have a gallery of recent artworks being displayed therein. 
It will raise awareness for events, and be a place for artists to see their work archived online.  

# UX
Although the taget audience for the site can be fairly broad, it is mainly for people who are interested in graffiti, but also for people who may be looking for events (music/art/sports) in the local area.
The target user will be anyone from 15-50+, so it is a must that the site functions just as well on a computer/laptop as it does on a phone/tablet.

The end-user who is unaware of existance of the 'Hall of Fame' will want information on the history, whereabouts and significance of the 'Hall of Fame' as well as news about future events at the 'Hall of Fame' or in the local area.





In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

# Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.


# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
